    \section{Introduction}
    \vspace{1px}
    I want to practice my coding skills. So I will create a Soccer simulator, based one of my first homeworks in Advanced Programming; which was a console Quiddich match simulator. \\
    
    For the project I want to try and use several of the things I learned afterwards in the course:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Polymorphism
        \item Multi-Threading
        \item GUI
    \end{itemize}

    I'll do it in C\# as I used that language in the course, however I could also try doing it in Python or C++.\\

    PS: This will also help me remember how to write TEX files

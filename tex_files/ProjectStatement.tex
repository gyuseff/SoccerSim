    \section{Introduction}
    \vspace{1px}
    I want to practice my coding skills. So I will create a Soccer simulator, based one of my first homeworks in Advanced Programming; which was a console Quiddich match simulator.\\
    For the project I want to try and use several of the things I learned afterwards in the course.\\
    I'll do it in C\# as I used that language in the course, however I could also try doing it in Python or C++.\\
    PS: This will also help me remember how to write TEX files

    \subsection{What I want to do}

    Here are some ideas that I want to try:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simulate a Soccer game with most of its rules
        \item Each player behaves independently following certain logic:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item What is the role of the player (Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfield, Attacker)
            \item The team is attacking or defending
            \item What is the position of the player
            \item What are the positions of the other player 
        \end{itemize}
        \item Make it chance-based for decisions and outcomes
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A player could try to make a difficult shot to the net, instead of an easy (and more intelligent) pass
            \item The player may miss a pass to a teammate that is alone
            \item A Goalkeeper may make score a goal by mere chance
        \end{itemize}
        \item Add stats to the players, which will increase their success chances for the plays
        \item Show all in a simple graphical way
        \item Maybe add user intervention by creating players of its own
        \item Maybe add a tournament mode
    \end{itemize}

    \subsection{What I want to remember}
    For This project I want to use these concepts (at least):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item OOP
        \item Graphical Interfases
        \item MultiThreading
        \item Polymorphism
    \end{itemize}
    
    \newpage
    \subsection{What I want to show}
    Use a very basic way to show the game:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Have a fixed background
        \item The ball and players represented with simple sprites (circles)
        \item Have the score and time showing in a corner
    \end{itemize}
